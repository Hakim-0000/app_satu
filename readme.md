# Vehicle Detection in Traffic Dataset using Faster R-CNN

This web app built for the purpose of deploying the machine learning model. The model trained using four different backbones inccluding ResNet50, ResNet50v2, MobileNetV3 Large, and MobileNetV3 Large 320.
### Reminder
This web app was built for detecting **Vehicle on a Traffic**, so if your images or video is not related to **Traffic**, you might get bad results or even does not get any results.

This web apps might run slow because it is using the ```'cpu'``` as a device.
